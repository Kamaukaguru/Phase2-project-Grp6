    "# Title:MODELING HOUSE PRICES USING DIFFERENT HOUSE FEATURES IN KING COUNTY.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.Introduction\n",
    "Owning a home is a significant financial decision. Understanding factors that influence house prices can empower both buyers and sellers to make informed choices. However, accurately determining a property's value can be complex due to various factors influencing house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "To gain insights into these factors, this study will analyze and model a dataset of house prices in King County. This analysis will focus on key factors such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and other property features like lot size. By leveraging data analysis, we aim to uncover the specific impact of these factors on property valuations and identify the most influential factors driving house prices. Additionally, we will investigate how these factors correlate with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study aims to provide valuable insights for both homeowners and potential buyers in King County by identifying the key drivers of house prices and their relationships.\n",

    "## 1.1 Project Overview/Business understanding\n",
    "Home sellers and buyers often struggle to determine the optimal pricing and value of a property. This project aims to analyze a dataset of homes sold in king county focusing on house prices and features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and neighborhood amenities. By understanding the relationships between these features and sale prices, we can develop insights to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Advise sellers (homeowners or developers) on data-driven strategies to enhance their properties for maximum sale price.\n",
    "2. Equip buyers with a clearer understanding of factors impacting home value, empowering them to make informed decisions during the buying process.\n",

    "# 1.2 Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2.1 Main objective\n",
    "To build and evaluate models using various combinations of the available house features in King County.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2.2 Specific objectives\n",
    "1. To evaluate how the number of floors impact the price of a house in King County.\n",
    "2. To determine how the number of bedrooms impact the price of a house in King County.\n",
    "3. To examine the impact the number of bathrooms has on the price of a house in King County.\n",
    "4. To determine how the square footage of living space of a house impacts house price in King County.\n",
    "5. To evaluate which combinations of the available features in the dataset are the most impactful features for predicting sale price.\n",

    "# 4.0 Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Modeled a baseline model to project price using squarefoot living.Since squarefoot living had a higher correlation with price\n",
    "\n",
    "projected house prices using simple linear regression\n",
    "\n",
    "2nd model:price vs bedrooms\n",
    "\n",
    "3rd model: price vs number of floors\n",
    "\n",
    "multiple linear regression model\n",
    "\n",
    "price vs no_of_bedrooms,sqftliving,floors\n",
    "\n",
    "# Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistically significant model was the multiple linear regression model.It had a higher r-squared of 35.3% as compared to other models\n",
    "and we were able to deduce the following,that:\n",
    "1. The square foot living and price had a higher correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The more the number of floors the higher the house price\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The less the number of bedrooms the higher the house price\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The Bigger the square foot living the higher the house price \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "The project yielded the desired results. The main objective and specific objectives are all satisfied.The results shows that the more the number of floors the higher the house price,the less the number of bedrooms the higher the house price and the Bigger the square foot living the higher the house price \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Recommendations\n",
    "1. We will recommend stakeholders to focus on properties with a lower bedroom count so that in return it will lead to an increase in price   of the house.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We will recommend stakeholders to Pay attention to the square footage of the living space. Increasing the living space generally increases the house price.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We will recommend stakeholders If feasible, explore opportunities to add or emphasize multiple floors in properties to increase their price value.\n"
